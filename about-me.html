            <p class="p-height">Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship. </p>

            <p class="p-height">It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>

            <p class="p-height">Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
            <p class="p-height">With how much it turned my life around, <span class="article-start">I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</span>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
